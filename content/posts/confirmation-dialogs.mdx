When building user interfaces, confirmation dialogs play a critical role in
ensuring users don’t accidentally perform destructive actions. However, managing
these dialogs can become messy without proper structure. In this blog, I’ll walk
you through creating a reusable confirmation dialog in React and Next.js using a
custom hook—an elegant and scalable solution for modern applications.

## The Challenge

Managing confirmation dialogs traditionally involves inline state management and
repetitive code, especially when used across multiple components. This approach:

- Clutters components with unnecessary state and logic.
- Lacks reusability, leading to inconsistent designs.
- Makes scaling and maintenance challenging.

## The Solution: A Reusable Hook

React’s hooks allow us to encapsulate stateful logic, making it easy to create
reusable, clean, and maintainable solutions. Let’s introduce `useConfirm`, a
custom hook that simplifies the process of implementing confirmation dialogs.

---

## The Code

Here’s the complete implementation of the `useConfirm` hook and the dialog
component:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

import { Button, type ButtonProps } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { ResponsiveModal } from '@/components/responsive-modal'
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle
} from '@/components/ui/card'

export const useConfirm = (
  title: string,
  message: string,
  variant: ButtonProps['variant'] = 'primary'
): [() => JSX.Element, () => Promise<unknown>] => {
  const [promise, setPromise] = useState<{
    resolve: (value: boolean) => void
  } | null>(null)

  const confirm = () => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setPromise({ resolve })
    })
  }

  const handleClose = () => {
    setPromise(null)
  }

  const handleConfirm = () => {
    promise?.resolve(true)
    handleClose()
  }

  const handleCancel = () => {
    promise?.resolve(false)
    handleClose()
  }

  const ConfirmDialog = () => (
    <ResponsiveModal open={!!promise} onOpenChange={handleClose}>
      <Card className='h-full w-full border-none shadow-none'>
        <CardContent className='pt-8'>
          <CardHeader className='p-0'>
            <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
            <CardDescription>{message}</CardDescription>
          </CardHeader>
          <div className='flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-end gap-x-2 gap-y-2 pt-4 lg:flex-row'>
            <Button
              onClick={handleCancel}
              variant={'outline'}
              className='w-full lg:w-auto'
            >
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button
              onClick={handleConfirm}
              variant={variant}
              className='w-full lg:w-auto'
            >
              Confirm
            </Button>
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </ResponsiveModal>
  )

  return [ConfirmDialog, confirm]
}
```

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Clean Separation of Concerns

The `useConfirm` hook encapsulates both the UI and state logic, keeping them
isolated from the main components. This reduces clutter and ensures that your
components remain focused on their primary responsibilities.

### 2. Reusable and Customizable

The `useConfirm` hook is designed with flexibility in mind. You can:

- Change the **title** and **message** to suit different contexts.
- Adjust the **button styles** using the `variant` prop for various actions
  (e.g., primary, destructive, or outline).

This allows you to reuse the dialog across different parts of your application
without duplicating code.

### 3. Scalable Design

By abstracting the confirmation dialog into a hook, this approach ensures
consistency and maintainability across your application. Even in projects with
multiple confirmation dialogs, you can rely on the same logic and styling,
making it easy to scale.

## Using the Hook

Here’s an example of how to use useConfirm in a component:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [ConfirmDialog, confirm] = useConfirm(
    'Delete Item',
    'Are you sure you want to delete this item?',
    'destructive'
  )

  const handleDelete = async () => {
    const isConfirmed = await confirm()
    if (isConfirmed) {
      console.log('Item deleted')
      // Perform your delete operation here
    } else {
      console.log('Deletion canceled')
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={handleDelete} variant='destructive'>
        Delete Item
      </Button>
      <ConfirmDialog />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Clean Separation of Concerns

The UI and state logic are isolated in the `useConfirm` hook, reducing clutter
in your components. This ensures each part of your application focuses on its
primary responsibility.

### Reusable and Customizable

The `useConfirm` hook is designed for flexibility:

- Easily adapt it for different actions by changing the **title** and
  **message**.
- Customize the dialog’s **button styles** using the `variant` prop (e.g.,
  primary, destructive, outline).

This reusability simplifies development and promotes consistency across your
application.

### Scalable Design

This pattern is highly scalable, making it ideal for projects with multiple
confirmation dialogs. By centralizing the logic and styling, you can ensure
consistency and maintainability as your application grows.

## Conclusion

With React hooks, managing confirmation dialogs becomes a breeze. The
`useConfirm` hook allows you to create **reusable**, **customizable**, and
**scalable** dialogs without cluttering your components.
